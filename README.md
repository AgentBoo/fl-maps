This is the base branch for the new react-based fl-maps.

Try it:
```javascript
git clone -b react-maps https://github.com/focallocal/fl-maps
cd fl-maps
meteor npm install
// Dont forget to include the settings.json file
npm run start
```

I'm aware of all the missiing features/styles etc, just wanted to share the work i've done so far.

Also, I've changed many core functionalites to match the current set of packages i've choosen to use + coding style is totaly different (for example: imports of files in favor of global declarations).

I'll update this README with more info when I will have some free time.

Let me know what you think!
